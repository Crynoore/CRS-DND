When Galrick went to get the dragon, he was informed that another guy (very posh guy) was involved. The party follows the rich guy, and he and his goons sit next to the road.

Nerup and Aromi-e have an interesting conversation without words, while Maru is distracted by the music.

Sarha casts a smoke field, causing the rich man to panic and alert the guards.

Maro steals the key to the cage.

Nerup jumps on the cage and yells, "What do you mean?"

Aromi-e spits acid and opens the cage, while Maru uses the key to open it.

Aromi-e starts running, and everyone follows suit.

Some small talk happens, and the guards fall.

After running for a while, they reach a small settlement where an old man talks about a metal dog terrorizing the village.

Nerup irritates the old man a bit, and Aromi-e takes him to the library ruins to find a book.

They find a book about El Rocko, and Galrick teaches Nerup five new words.

Shara and Nerup create some light, causing strange magic to happen.

They head to the cave and find a dead body being eaten by rats.

Nerup tries to investigate the rats.

Aromi-e provides information about the first heroes before they venture deeper into the cave.

They encounter a goblin and Shara steps on a spike, leading them to jump to Shara's hometown.

They meet Jan Druid, an elf who is 500 years old, and encounter more challenges.

They find the end of the cave where there is a beam of light and hear metal creaking.

They sneak towards the sound and face the metal hound.

The group battles the hound, which splits into three.

They defeat the hound and find a "Cog of Metal Mutt" when looting it.

They leave the cave and return to the old man to share how they defeated the beast.

Maru speaks Dwarfish to the old man, Lukhet Hamergorg, who tells him about the whereabouts of Jhosuwa.

They learn about the mark on the cog being related to the Moradlin, the Fearun god of dwarfs.

Nerup mentions a rainbow, and they see a shack in the distance.
