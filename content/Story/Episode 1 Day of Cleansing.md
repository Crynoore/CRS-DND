[[Caypolis]]
Festival = Cleansing day

I arrive at closed gates -> lots of people (non human + homeless)

< Racism? Classism? people complain alot about new king 🙁(of caypolis)

King ‘overthrew the regime’, an old fella love reminiscing of the past but smells like shit

~ [Njirp](content/Names/Green%20and%20scales/リ⋮╎∷!¡.md) gets true striked

< Old man does’nt know alot about “Oogwa”

[[Maru]] played some music and says I should try Maru-wana

Dad man says 4 loxodon have been seen in the past year.

glowing mud thrown, gate held open, Maru and others got in

I got locked up in jail

“even though it has only been seconds, it feels like years have passed”

In an act of insanity I wrote “welcome” on the wall with shit

~The others are speaking in the alleys 

I used my magical hand to retrieve the keys of my cellblock after which I begged Selune for forgiveness 

I then enjoyed Maru’s tunes for a bit

~[[Sarah]] bought [njirp](content/Names/Green%20and%20scales/リ⋮╎∷!¡.md) some clothes after which she got kidnapped and invited to a mysterious happening, she got kicked out shortly after.

 [[Maru]] is a lovely artist with a real talent for the harmonica, I am however concerned about his age. He told me he wrote this song over 1000 years ago??? I guess what they tell you about Tortles is wrong after all.

He preformed another wonderful song, this one from when the humans first came to Bâlz…that’s so long ago… I told him a bit about myself, where I’m from and how my people are. I even teached him about when deserts and cacti are.

~[Njirp](content/Names/Green%20and%20scales/リ⋮╎∷!¡.md) and  [[Sarah]] are gambling and earned 16GP together.

I..I managed to convince Maru to shoot a bolt at a guard. I healed him not long after.. but I still feel bad, it did create the perfect window to escape

~shoey’s inn [Nijrip](content/Names/Green%20and%20scales/リ⋮╎∷!¡.md) and [[Sarah]] enter and talk to lady who promised to get her out
