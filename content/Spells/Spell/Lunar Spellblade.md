lunar Spellblade
	Transmutation cantrip 
	Casting Time: 1 bonus action 
	Range: Touch 
	Components: V, S, M (A silvered weapon) 
	Duration: 1 minute 

 - The silvered weapon you are holding is imbued with lunar power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already and deals radiant damage. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
