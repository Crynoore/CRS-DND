  

upon the lands of ……. there was a vast drought coust by a giant fungus ``
This one fungus was the size of a castle, not only that it was also in the form of a castle.
forever empty no one living in the fungus house. 

  

There were those who wanted to remove this but that was not as easy as gardening for mushrooms. from the smallest cut vast amounts of poison gas would come out of the hole.
fire was the only good way to get rid of it, but if you even mist the smallest spot it would just regrow like you did nothing. 
it is not that that would be that easy with it constantly sprouting the same gas. 

  

this is how it was for the longest time just growing bigger and bigger not getting halted by anything in its way. 

  

but then it happened there was movement in the caste.
It was a massive critter being pale white on its whole body except for its eyes all of them being a blackish blue. the impure king was awoken 
a priest from a local church started casting a fire wall to keep it away from the small village that was no more than 82 minutes away. 
After a while all the priests were all casting the same spell hoping the critter will not get to the village. but for how long they tried it did not last.

  

but before all the hope was lost one of the …….. priest arrived he rust in and slade the beast in only a few minutes only leaving its eyes behind. he asked the locals to get the eyes as far apart from one another fearing that the impure king might be able to restore if all its eyes would be togetter for to long 

  

(what realy happened)

the priest did slay the beast, but not as fast and also kinde did not kill its heard he just locket the heard in one of the temple.
