- Meet me glassy eyed, blind, and divine
- on the coast of a hill there it lise, crumbling castle 
- not do time not to man, crumbling castle 
- in a way far for land it may be, crumbling castle 
- i have heard of the lands to the side 
- under the void it resides 
- Are we safe in our citadel? 
- On this very day, in one thousand 
- Years the earth will be relative to the 
- Sun and the moon and a new world will be 
- Created, I know because it is written here 
- in a way i sway back and forth 
- I'm brittle as an aged human being 
- I don't want nothing but to live on 
- The ache inside my keep spurs me on 
- I don't want to be visible
