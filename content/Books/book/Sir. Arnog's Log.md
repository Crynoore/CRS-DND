they came form the North in droves, we don't know what it was. but all that there's left is flesh, blood and the scent of death. but hey if you found this you probably see that.
i found a group of people that had a boat, we will seal the sea in hope of fining a better place.

there should still be a small Supplies stash at the top of the light house, we did not take al that was left 

good luck
