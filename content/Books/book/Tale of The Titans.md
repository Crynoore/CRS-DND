# Tale of The Titans
by [[Jeremiah]]
### Titan Physiology

The Titans possess a range of physiologies that vary dramatically between individuals. Their skin is incredibly resilient, often covered in thick layers of armor-like scales and tough, leathery hide. This outer layer is capable of withstanding extreme environmental conditions, from the intense pressure of ocean depths to the searing heat of volcanic activity. with then a layer of rocks and mud and lots of natural resources. 

### Titan Ecosystems

Each Titan supports its own unique ecosystem, creating microhabitats that are distinct from the surrounding world. The ecosystems range from lush forests and rolling plains to barren, rocky landscapes and frozen tundra's. The flora and fauna on these Titans have adapted to the specific conditions present on each Titan, resulting in unique and often bizarre lifeforms. Likely form where they stead the longest on the world. it would only make sense for if a titan lives in the most norther part of the world that is would have more of a ices environment. with then ice elements keeping it like this is it moves.

### Titan Movement and Behavior

Titans move slowly, their massive bodies requiring significant effort to traverse the landscape. Their movement patterns are influenced by a variety of factors, including environmental conditions, availability of resources, and, in some cases, what seems to be a form of instinctual migration. Some Titans are known to travel great distances over centuries, while others remain largely stationary, becoming part of the landscape itself.

### Interaction with Elf's

Throughout history, Elf's civilizations have interacted with the Titans in various ways. Some have built entire cities on their backs, while others have formed symbiotic relationships, relying on the Titans for resources and protection. The Titans are often revered as gods or mythical beings, their presence woven into the cultural and religious fabric of societies.
## Date: -Date of Discovery-


Today, our expedition took an unexpected turn as we stumbled upon a spectacle unlike anything documented before. The colossal creatures we have encountered, which we have come to call “the Titans”, defy everything known about monsters and animals

  
Even the smallest of these specimens are larger than most mountains I’ve seen to date. From a considerable distance, the unmistakable outline of a moving island is still visible, leaving us in awe of the sheer magnitude of these creatures.

Yesterday we finally finished our expedition across the titan we call [[Titranuvigus]].

It is these grand Titans that are truly shocking. These colossal beings are of such staggering proportions that traversing took us years, some might even take decades.

Astonishingly, this Titan was adorned with entire cities upon their back. The very existence of such colossal entities challenges our understanding of the natural world.

It seems in recent years not many Titans remain active. Yet, we discovered some titans moving towards a place we now call “[[The Titan Lands]]”. It consists of multiple dormant laying Titans. It is absolutely massive compared with The First Continent. With 2 of the main Titans each being approximately 2 times the size of The First Continent. 


As we continue our expedition, I am filled with a sense of profound wonder and anticipation for the discoveries that await us in this realm of colossal marvels.

We encountered another Titan today, one we have named [[Goliathor]]. Unlike [[Titranuvigus]], [[Goliathor]] appears to be more mobile. with vast forests and rivers traverse its back, forming an ecosystem of their own. The biodiversity found on this Titan is unlike anything we've seen before, with unique flora and fauna thriving on its immense body.

Source told us of a Titan Name [[Leviathanis]], which dwells primarily in the deepest parts of the  oceans. Its size is unparalleled, even among Titans, stretching across hundreds of miles. [[Leviathanis]]'s movements create tidal waves and influence ocean currents. Remarkably, this Titan hosts Marine ecosystem, with Reef and caves that go into its flesh and scales, a testament to the adaptability and ingenuity of lifeforms residing on these colossal beings.

## Date: -Date of Discovery- many decades later

We have finally mapped out the entirety of the region known as “[[The Titan Lands]].” This area is a sanctuary for the remaining Titans, a place where they gather and rest. The landscape here is a patchwork of biomes, each Titan contributing to the diversity of the environment. Some Titans lie dormant for centuries, their bodies forming mountains and valleys, while others roam slowly, altering the terrain as they move.
## Date: -Date of Discovery- a few years later

Our most recent journey has taken us to the Titan [[Volctusu]], a fiery behemoth whose back is a landscape of lava flows and volcanic craters. This Titan seems to generate geothermal energy, which powers the small resilient communities of DragonBorn's that have adapted to its extreme conditions. The heat and ash create a challenging environment, yet life persists in remarkable ways.


## Date: -Date of Discovery- many Years later

In what might be one of our Greatest discoveries, we have found [[Eternus]], a Titan that appears to be ancient beyond measure. Its body is covered in a dense forest of colossal trees, some of which have trunks as wide as city streets. [[Eternus]] moves so slowly that its progress is almost imperceptible, and its age is reflected in the deep, weathered lines of its skin. The forest on its back is home to a myriad of species that seem to have evolved uniquely in this isolated, arboreal ecosystem.

As we continue to document and explore the wonders of the Titans, our sense of wonder only deepens. The legacy of our expeditions will endure, inspiring future generations to seek out and understand the majestic and mysterious Titans that roam our world.

## Date: -Date of Discovery- many centuries later

Legends of the Titans have become myths, their existence doubted by many. Yet, our records and maps preserve the truth of these magnificent beings. The Titans, whether dormant or wandering, continue to shape the world in ways beyond our comprehension. Our expedition, spanning my hole elf life, and yet we only scratched the surface of understanding these colossal creatures and their role in the natural order.

''we leave behind a legacy of exploration and discovery, a testament to the enduring wonder and mystery of the Titans.''
