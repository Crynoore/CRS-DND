Date: -Date of Discovery-

  

Today, our expedition took an unexpected turn as we stumbled upon a spectacle unlike anything documented before. The colossal creatures we have encountered, which we have come to call “the Titans”, defy everything known about monsters and animals

  

Even the smallest of these specimens are larger than most mountains I’ve seen to date. From a considerable distance, the unmistakable outline of a moving island is still visible, leaving us in awe of the sheer magnitude of these creatures.

Yesterday we finally finished our expedition across the titan we call [[Titranuvigus]].

It is these grand Titans that are truly shocking. These colossal beings are of such staggering proportions that traversing took us years, some might even take decades.

Astonishingly, this Titan was adorned with entire cities upon their back. The very existence of such colossal entities challenges our understanding of the natural world.

It seems in recent years not many Titans remain active. Yet, we discovered some titans moving towards a place we now call “[[The Titan Lands]]”. It consists of multiple dormant laying Titans. It is absolutely massive compared with The First Continent. With 2 of the main Titans each being approximately 2 times the size of The First Continent. 

  

As we continue our expedition, I am filled with a sense of profound wonder and anticipation for the discoveries that await us in this realm of colossal marvels.
