The Awakening of Aronim-e

  
![[Crynoore felle.png]]]
the wise archmage [[Cyrus]] stole a dragon egg to revive this dead brother 

but after the egg hatched(year 1618) Aronim-e was born ,

Named after the mountain he was found on (one of the mountains in the nortle range(Aronimi)

[[Cyrus]] was scared to get eaten by the dragon  
but he didn't have the heart to take its life so he raised it as his own son

  

### -Day 7: of having a dragon in your home-

Today was a bit more peaceful than the past 4.

He no longer just shit and pissed where he wants and that in just 7 days.

I'm fascinated by the speed he learns to do things,

but flying is not really one of them, it's not like i can teach him how to use his wings,

I guess those are things he will have to figure out on his own. :)

  

### -Day 16: of having a dragon in your home-

BIG PROBLEM

[[Galiminus]] is coming to my isle and i have a dragon

How am I going to explain this to him?

it's not like  having a dog or something.

This guy is known to erase cities.

Maybe I can try to keep him in one of the towers on the edge of the islands.

  

### -Day 18: well i guess he is Officially part of the family.-

[[Galiminus]] came a week earlier than he said, not like him to not follow the plans so strict

but hey he is getting older as well.

he was surprisingly not against the dragon roaming the place,

he even said he wanted part of it, mosty he wanted to have a dragon in his family 

‘’It would be cool he said’’ yea yea until he breaks your family photos.

but i gave in and he is officially his uncle and he convinced me to name it more than just ‘’a dragon’’, he went on a whole story of the dragon we battled, the places we went before and then it came to me, Aronim-e it's like the mountain Aronimi but just altered a bit.

  

### -Day 63: human i guess-

[[Galiminus]] had an idea of making Aronim-e a human so he could leave the island and come visit him. i said that it was gonna be way too hard i mean its a dragon known for being well.. full of magic, how am i supposed to make something to convert all that in to a small form 

but it would help because he is starting to get too big to fit into the main room.

i will try, but i don't think i will be able to do this

  

### -Day 67: Yagor the man-..

[[Galiminus]] came on another surprise visit and told me about a prodigy called [[Yagor]]

He makes magical things like no other, he said.

I will go on a little trip to see what it is all about and if he is so good I will invest in some equipment.

Now that [[Galiminus]] is here I can leave the island and keep Aronim-e supervised by someone.

at least i will not need to worry about the whole island standing in flames

  

### -Day 72: start of insanity-

i came back to my island 2 days ago and wow, how can 1 guy and 1 dragon do so much damage, like things I thought that couldn't move were broken.

Luckily my quarters were mostly untouched.

and so i started experimenting on things, i will not experiment on Aronim-e he feels to much like family 

  

### -Day 88: the endless search-

I am going insane. I have tried like 5 000 different things .

I can not even leave the island, this guy has become very big.

He can't even enter the house anymore, and I think he is getting sad that he doesn't get to see me as much.

But that's why I gotta make this thing.

  

### -Day 96: BREAKTHROUGH-

I heard about a book of curses and know not really something you want to give to your son but you know it is what it is.

so i send [[Galiminus]] to find it for me 

cursed items will like have a higher amount of mana infuse with it so i have i can make something work without any side effects,

and the transforming part is mostly figured out.

  

### -Day 107: the book and the sheeps-

[[Galiminus]] got the book. Now I just figured out how to use the thing in the book, and I would like to finish it fast.

all the merchants started looking weird at me now that i come by every week and buy 5 sheep 

But Aronim-e is hungry and growing fast. I started making a wall that keeps him on the island so he will not leave and terrorize coastal villages.

Hopefully I will finish the process of making something.

  

### -Day 136: im am the best mage know to man-

I finished it. It should work. I have checked everything like 5 times, and I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work.

so now i just have to wait for [[Galiminus]] to arrive he wanted to be there when Aronim-e was becoming a real boy, he should arrive in a week or so.

  

### -Day 144: Its time-

[[Galiminus]] has arrived on the ile.

Now just to get it on him, it's a necklace made from [[cosmic brass]], some material I got from [[Yagor]]. [[Galiminus]] made it into a ouroboros of a dragon, he found it fitting for a dragon.

I have chosen a curse of binding for it since it is not really the idea for him to take it off and it made infusing it with enough mana easier. 

[[Galiminus]] also got him a small gift its a family binding to make him really part of the family 

i know he wanted a dragon as a pet when he was small but this is going a bit far 

like one of these binding are pretty rare and expensive but i guess if he wants to make it so official i allow him.
(necklace is [[Insignia of Enshacklement]])
### -Day 145: my boy-

well he is more human than before but more like a dragonborn or so 

but hey that is more socially accepted then having a dragon in your house.

unbeknownst to me he knows how to talk draconic i guess that is just something he got form his real parents.

..

it really makes me think of the dragon that we killed, we could have reasons with it, it is not some mindless killing machine but a sentient caring being.

it was just protecting its child 

at least thats is how i think of it 

[[Galiminus]] is more on the you raise him well and that's why he didn't kill you 

but i think there's more to this than just that but hey i still have time to figure that out 

now it's time to teach my boy, how to well be a boy

  

### -Year 4 Day 147: i get it-

Aronim-e has taught me how to speak draconic, it was quite a difficult language to learn

it also sound more like a dialect of the common draconic that i have heart, but he is adamant that he i richt and i guess he would know he is a dragon after all

he is also already fluent in english and he has started to learn elvish 

### -year 17 day 55: i going back on a avenger-

I wanna know what dragons are all about. All that is written in books is how they kill and some go over what to do if you have killed one. and i thought that old gods were hard to find thinks on but dragon are even more elusive.

  

It does help that [[Galiminus]] wants to see Aronim-e again so I gave him an invite to come to my island and look after him for a while.

The other guy from the old party finds it weird that I still do so much research and only live on my island. I heard that [[Ulysses]] bought a huge castle in Bâlz and regularly throws massive parties. That is no big surprise knowing him he has about 60 children rn.

  

### -year 24 day 1 :he want to know what i do-

Aronim-e got very interested in what I do all of a sudden.

Well, I'm happy to teach him how to do some basic magic. I hope that the way humans and dragons channel energy is the same. but i feel like it's not gonna be that way.

  

### -year 24 day 50 :he is all but a natural-

I think it's the way that we channel magic, I mean I hope so otherwise I'm just the worst teacher known to man. and that is something that would surprise me last time i checked i was one of the best mages known to ever be alive.

but well he know a bit of it at least, i will try for 1 year but after that im getting him a dragon teacher 

### -year 36 day 257 :a dragon has connected me-

i am sure of it, i didn't get much but i feel like i got a signal of a big creature

and it's not the first time even but this time i saw it, a big head just looking at me 

I don't know what it is or maybe I'm just going mad.

but i sure hope it is a dragon


—-----------------------------------------------------

[[Cyrus]] taught him alot in the 45 years that they were together 1663

  

‘’it's a peaceful night’’ i tell him, he has not left his bed for 3 month by now and it is not getting better i feel worried about him but he has said this would happen at some point 

But I dont think I'm ready for it to happen now.

The last words that [[Cyrus]] said to me Were ‘’I hope I was not to Protective of you,I was scared of you from the first moment I saw you, even now I don't know if I did enough to prepare you for what the world is.  
you might hear stories of me that make me out as a wise, calm and fearless man,

but just know that i was more like a scared rat even now i'm scared,

if you want to know more go to your uncle [[Galiminus]] he is the only other person that knows about you.

now you have my permission to leave the ile.’’

with [[Cyrus]] saying this the wall around the island stop holding back Aronim-e

  

but he didn't leave not for a while but he knows that one day he will have to leave this island and find a new way to live

  

after [[Cyrus]] died Aronim-e left the island (iIe of Cyrus)

to find out what he was gonna do with his time 

not knowing that he had a lot more time then [[Cyrus]]

  
  

he wanted to know why he was not Allowed off the island before [[Cyrus]] died

after he got a grasp on how the world works outside of the ile of [[Cyrus]].

  

He went to Cle, a small village only really known for one guy, [[Yagor]].

[[Yagor]] is a master in Identifying and making magical items.

but the necklace that Aronim-e had he could only say was storing a lot of energy 

  

with this he went on his way and became friend ([[Fezel]])with a archer that Taught him how to use a bow and with this knowledge and [[Fezel]] telling him about the land of Bâlz 

trying to find a lead to a relative of [[Galiminus]].
