At the age of twelve, I underwent an unexpected transformation that forever altered the course of my life. In the midst of a heated confrontation, I inadvertently tumbled into a mysterious cauldron filled with an enchanting liquid. The consequences were astonishing: I underwent a drastic change, morphing into a creature resembling a fish, adorned with shimmering scales and graceful fins.

  

This transformation ignited an inner journey of self-discovery. At home, I gradually learned to accept and navigate my new form. Yet, a deep yearning for connection and acceptance continued to burn within me.

  

The annual festival, a distant spectacle I had only observed from afar, became a beacon of hope and desire. Each year, I heard the sounds, smelled the scents, and felt the excitement of the festivities, yet I lived too far away to attend. I remained on the sidelines, hidden from the world around me.

  

Despite knowing I was different from others, the desire to be part of this spectacle continued to grow. At the age of sixteen, I could no longer ignore it. With a mixture of fear and determination, I made the decision to leave my sanctuary and embark on a long journey to the festival, despite my unusual appearance and the distance I had to travel.

  

It was an adventure fraught with challenges and uncertainties, yet it also brought unexpected encounters and profound connections. During the festival, I discovered that true acceptance was not contingent upon my outward appearance but rather on the courage to reveal my true self.

  

Although I was only sixteen and had never before attended the festival, this experience marked the beginning of my journey toward self-acceptance and my quest for connection with others, regardless of my unusual appearance. And though the road ahead may be long, I am determined to take each step with my head held high, knowing that I am not alone in my journey toward authenticity and connection.

Personal purpose:

Your goal appears to be twofold: self-acceptance and connection with others.Â 

  

Firstly, you are on a journey to fully accept and embrace your unique identity, despite the drastic transformation that turned you into a fish-like being. This journey likely involves coming to terms with your new appearance and finding inner peace and confidence in who you are.

  

Secondly, you seek connection with others, despite any initial fears or uncertainties about how they may perceive you. This desire for connection suggests a longing for understanding, acceptance, and belonging within a community or among peers, transcending physical differences and embracing the essence of who you are as an individual.

  

By pursuing these goals, you aim to find fulfillment, acceptance, and a sense of belonging in both yourself and in your interactions with others, ultimately leading to a richer and more meaningful life journey.
