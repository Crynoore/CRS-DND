![[6. Garrick Salutes the moon.png]]


This is the tale of a wise loxodon man who devoted his life to the Godess [[Selune]].

  

At the young age of 190 (year 1572) Garrick decided to join the Church of the moon in his small village Hortsvile near the Black road in Anouroch.

Anouroch was a vast scorching hot desert in central Fearûn.

He had been living there with his mother, father and his younger brother Kemahl.

The next 25 or so years (year 1597) were spent praying to the Moonmaiden, cleaning the chapels and preaching to the people of Hortsvile.

Until on a fateful night while praying to the [Moonmother](Selune.md) she descended down from the skies and spoke to Garrick.

“[[The Continent of Bâlz]] is losing faith in me, the lady of silver. I command thee to go there and spread the word. In return I shall grant you a lunar blessing”

Without hesitation Garrick agreed and the pact was sealed.

The next morning Garrick grabbed his things, said farewell to his brethren, his family and set out on a mission.

After about a month of travel he arrived at Zhentil Keep where he met a sailor who he paid handsomely. This man brought him to [[The Continent of Bâlz]].

Guided by the [Moonmaiden](Selune.md) with wind in their sails they traveled southeast for about 2 years (year 1599) and made it Bâlz. They arrived hungry at a small port in the town of [[Eurgh]].

The people there were unwelcoming and quite honestly quite sticky.

They would not believe a single word of what Garrick had to say but Garrick was persistent and spent the next 38 years (year 1637) of his life converting the town of [[Eurgh]] to selunites.

After he had established his goals there he decided to go into a deep meditation.

He had been told shoes mountain was beautiful this time of year and so he setted out with a rowboat.

After much struggle rowing and hiking he made it to the top âdïddas where he meditated for a year (year 1638) honing his connection to the moon.

From the top of âdïddas he saw a swamp across the sea and decided to go there in search of new folks to convert.

It was a long and arduous adventure where he encountered a very small settlement of about 10-ish people. He tried hard to convert them but listen they did not.

They were an old bunch of folk who still believed in Helm (yuck so 1205).

However they did offer him a boat ride to the desert (they really just wanted to get rid of Garrick).

Once in the desert he was told to head west towards the town of [[Gyrosma]]. (year 1639)

After about a day's travel and total dehydration he arrived and was met with a joyful bunch of people.

They gave him water and some food and listened to his tales.

Years passed (45) (year 1684) and he established a chapel in the center of [[Gyrosma]].

People would visit to hear of the lady of silver and pray to her.

But that wasn’t enough, on another fateful night [[Selune]] came to him again and spoke of a town called [[Caypolis]] who he was told had no beliefs.

It would be his greatest challenge yet but of course he accepted (such a simp).

He spoke to the people of [[Gyrosma]] about his new goal, some were excited, others saddened by the news.

That same evening he set out on his journey, the moonlight shining upon him.

But as he was about to head out the gate the town’s blacksmith walked up to him and handed him a crescent shaped blade.

He thanked the man and headed off. Along the way he met many people and visited plenty of villages yet he could not stay long, he had a mission.

It took him approximately 3 years but finally in the distance he could see the wall surrounding [[Caypolis]]…
