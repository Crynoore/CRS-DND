go back to [[Feast of the Moon 2024]]

In a secluded alchemical laboratory deep in the fields of an unknown location in the forgotten realms, an ambitious scholar named Ullem sought to create the ultimate substance: the alkahest, the legendary universal solvent that could dissolve anything (even the mythical philosophers stone), breaking down matter to its fundamental elements. To succeed, the alchemist chose to work with Mercury, not just the element but the very essence of transformation. The alchemist believed that only through the use of a new moon during the blackening phase, when the essence of transformation, purification and most of all dissolvability, the true alkahest be created.
As the alchemist prepared the final stages of the experiment, the moon entered its new moon phase, a time of dissolution and potential, the beginning of the blackening stage in alchemical transformation. The moon, dark and unseen, symbolized the breaking down of old forms, mirroring Mercury’s fluid nature. At this time, the moon was in perfect alignment, enhancing the transformative power the alchemist sought to wield.
But something went wrong….. :00
Instead of the universal solvent, the alchemical reaction birthed a new form of life—a living, sentient plasmoid. This creature, born from the volatile fusion of Mercury’s essence and the alignment of the celestial bodies, was unlike anything the alchemist had intended. The plasmoid’s form was fluid, ever-changing, just like the element that gave it life. It could shift and flow, transforming itself at will, a being made of amorphous matter with the to reform itself into new shapes.
The alchemist, overwhelmed by the unexpected result, vanished, leaving behind their notes, half-finished theories, and the plasmoid, who was left to wander the world in search of answers. 
The plasmoid embraced its role as an artificer alchemist, manipulating the elements and crafting tools, potions, and devices using the principles of Alchemy. It could reform metals, infuse potions with transformative power, and even alter its own form to adapt to any situation. But the question that haunted the plasmoid was the same one that had driven its creator: the secret of the alkahest, the formula left unfinished in the wake of its own creation.
Now, drawn by the pull of fate and the celestial alignments once more, the plasmoid has arrived in the town of Red Larch, just in time for the Feast of the Moon. The night is alive with celebration, but the plasmoid is focused on the town’s annual Midnight Moon Mansion Mission. The mansion, rumored to hold ancient puzzles and hidden alchemical knowledge, beckons to the plasmoid, who believes that the alignment of the moon during the mission could reveal the final pieces of the alkahest formula within its walls…..
