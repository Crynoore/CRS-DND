How to make Chimera attempt 23


I got some new specimens for the Void. where I have been craving to attempt to make a new creature, with the success of the last one. Even though it did not have the intelligence that I was hoping for, I did listen to basic commands. and now that i have all these new part i must be able to make a chimera that can sustain itself  for a long time.  
  

#### Ingredients 
- 15kg of Wandering Vagrents Mesoglea 
- about 1ich Gastrodermis per nerve
- 1 Gargntuan Leviaten rib bones 
- 6 chelicerate eyes 
- 32 chelicerate teeth 
- a chelicerate Malpighian tubule system
- some Ghose Eel intestine
- 2l oger blood
- 6g of limited edition summer salt
- the brain of a local (alive works better)
- the Respiratory system of a loxodon 
- a Overloading Heart
- essense of ▇▇▇▇▇


while this it happening you can start with making all the bones you will need out of you big main bone don't forget any bones 

collet the Mesoglea on the Chauntea table and start casting.

when you mesoglea goop is starting to take shape insert the bones.

get all the intestine accept for the heart and put them into the vessel.

  

now with this empty vessel you can start to model it how you like (you have about 2 days time to do this )

don't forget to put in the eyes and the teeth at this point

preheat the oven on 90°

  

put the oger blood in the oven and get it warm(not boling just warm)

wait a good min then add the salt and the heart to the blood

use the essense to cast ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 

and keep this going for about 6 to 8 hours 

  

and voila your very own chimera, at least i hope so

I have done some calculations and this should add up but I could be off with a few things but it is not like I am running low on ingredients.
