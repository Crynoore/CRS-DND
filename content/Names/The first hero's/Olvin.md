prologue

At the Young age of 6 (year 1558)his man was already a master of the sword besting his peers.

coming from a well standing family in the middle of the Noden, he was proclaimed as the golden child of the family 

and went on all sorts of trips with his father.

This made it so he didn't really see his siblings all that much.

He was just practicing day in day out for all his young years.

before the age of 14 (year 1566) he was seen as the perfect swords man,

with skill that no one could match.

but that was also the only skill he was particularly good at,

He didn't know how to carry a conversation, cook or even trade.

all he knew was how to fight in a regulated sword fight.

but when he wanted to rest for a bit and ketchup with his siblings

since it was a good 2,5 years since they had seen each other.

but a lot of rest was not what he was getting since the evil was invading 

The family tried to stay but the evil was persistent and vast.

for a good year they stayed but it was getting harder and harder to just survive.

what is money worth if there is no other vendor to trade with.

  

so they started traveling to somewhere where the evil was not present,

but Vinroso (father) did not what to leave, but Luna (mother) was adamant about leaving so she took the children and left for a better place not knowing if there were any good places left.

This was devastating for Olvin as his father was kinde his only family. 

but for his siblings they didn't share this sadness.

As for the siblings, Vinroso was pretty much a stranger.

Vinroso did not give any attention to Frevin, Delu or Juvin after Olvin was born.

he was to obsessed by Olvin’s potential

but there was no time to be sad, it was run or die.

Until they got to a small settlement next to the sea. 

  

they gave the last thing they had to get on a boot to the content of Bâlz.

they didn't know what this place was.

  

after the long and painful travel to Bâlz  (year 1570)

they had new problems with nothing to their name and no more status.

They started working 2 jobs each just to get by.

all this until Olvin heard about the plans of a party to go back and clean the first continent.

(year 1573) he is 20 years old

so after telling his mother and sibling that he was going back and they could not stop him

He packed his stuff what was mostly just a sword he couldn't get rid of and an empty bag.

he went to the boot and the fought the evil for the next 35 years

  

epilogue

After he came back he was happy it was over but sad that the only family he knew was dead, even though all his siblings were still alive.

he felt as if he was alone, like there was nothing left for him.

So after the day of return was over, he left and the other heroes did not know where he went.

they didn't really know that much about him, they had no idea of his family, all they knew was that his father was dead and the place where he grew up was in ruins.

Olvin needed to find peace with his siblings.

but after he found them he just felt sad, like a broken man.

All he was good in was no longer needed; the evil was gone.

There was no place for him, he had become the best fighter in his time.

but at what cost.

  

he roamed around traveling and living on the coins that he got for slaying monsters.

As he passed through towns he saw the status of him and his party looking happy.

but all he could think about was all the time he spent looking for things that were not there.

his father after they left, a connection between him and his sibling ,a night not in fear of disappointments.

  

but with him turning 60 he taught about his end, and how he knows all of combat but if he goes,no one will know the real struggle he went through.

All that will linger is the victory ,the peace , the easy times.

but easy time is not what makes a good warrior.

He was going to find an apprentice that would get all the knowledge and story he had to offer.
