go back to start [[First-hero's]]

**The Epilogue of Gallimimus

  

We did it, we saved [[The First Continent]]

Took us long enough, I have seen every part of that place and I'm fine not seeing 80% of never again.

But now that I have seen all of the first continent and the discovery of other land masses I want to see them.

  

i'll start with [[The Continent of Faerûn]]

it look to be the most interesting of the ones we know currently

I mean if your competition is a place called [[The Continent of Bâlz]], you don't have to try hard.

Also the dwarfs are not that happy that the humans have taken about 40% of their land for themselves.

and i think I deserve a break after 15 years of combat, talking about combat i did not see [[Olvin]] et or great event.

I think that guy has the toughest time of us all, he needs to get some time to rest.

but hey if i see that guy again i will help him any way i can,

He saved my life many times so it seems fair to help him when he needs it.

  
  

it only took me 2 year to get to this place,

and I got [[Cyrus]] to come with me. I asked the other 2 but they didn't answer.

I mean [[Cyrus]] said no, he was gonna study some more books or all that.

but i said to him that he can get my books of the old gods that's on my island.

It's crazy how we got a whole ass island named after us.

I wonder what will happen to the island after we move on.

like will it just become an uninhabited island like before or are they gonna make them into museums or something.

but we still have time before that happens, now for us to enjoy Faerûn and all their things.

  

So the plans are to go to the following 

-Neverwinter big library

-waterdeep

-baldur's gate

-helm’s hold

-Candlekeep big library

-Karse

  

Cyrus begged me to go to the neverwinter underground library, I was planning on only staying for the techfest and a day extra but Cyrus insisted that we stayed longer. So it turned into a good 2 weeks, just for some books. I guess that is the reason that he got so smart, but still it's a vacation you need to relax a bit.

  

Baldur's gate 

My parents went there once, they told me all about this place. Their stories about this place made it sound way cooler than it is.

But this place is old, so a lot of old gods still have shines here and the people still clean them. So I will visit that and maybe I will finally get an answer from a god.

  

Karse

Some crazy stuff happened here

**something something time**

  
  

Years Later 

  

It has been very calm the last few months Cyrus and Aronem-i have been living together As a family. That is the last guy i was thinking was getting a son i mean the way he did it is kind of cheating  but hey good for him.

My family life has been easy now that the kids have their own place off the island, finally I have to relax and enjoy time with my wife. 

  

Sometime later 

For me being one of the worst paladins from my school back when I was a kid, I have done the most out of any of My classmates.

But even now I have struggled Getting connected with a god, you would think any god would want my ass, you know the savior of the first continent ,but now the only time I get a connection is when my life is in danger. 

  

I'll Just start looking for the 1 god who cares enough to lend me their Strength.

But with an oath to a god who won't show up to you, it will be hard to talk another god into Letting me present them.

  

I have found a place that will allow me to see the god that abandoned me when I was a kid. I will finally get to ask him how,why he stopped acknowledging me. And tell him what a mistake that was.

  
  

**The Plane of balance**

  

Galiminus: TELL ME WHY YOU NEVER INTERACTED WITH ME.

Begalaz: ow You wanna know why all this time no god has answered You.

Galiminus: YES.

Begalaz: they are likely Scared.

Galiminus: AND WAY WOULD THAT BE.

Begalaz : do you even know who you are yelling to

Galiminus: no(scared)

Begalaz :(yells)I'm Begalaz the god of balance, and I made my mark on you when you were small.

And no other sane god would dare come close to you. 1 god did but he is forgotten by now.

Galiminus:(remember the small amount of connection he felt when he was a kid)

begalaz :you are special, you don't need to pledge your allegiance to one god.

You must have known, how else were you able to use your magic, it is not like you studied like your friend thare , it's not even in your bloodline, and yet you use it like you know every god.

Galiminus:(stunt)

Begalaz :and now that you are here we can chat .

Galiminus:.……

Begalaz :don't be scared now, you were yelling at me just a minute ago. 

Galiminus:So you are the reason I was a failure.

Begalaz : I wouldn't call it that.

Galiminus:those people shitted on me for my inability to connect to a god.

Begalaz :Don't look so shallow into it.

Galiminus:You made my life a hell.

Begalaz :and here I thought you of all people would be different, and yet i Am disappointed.

What did you gain form this?

Galiminus : pain

begalaz: no think 

Galiminus :about what

Begalaz :what did you do after all that

Galiminus : i …i..

Begalaz : I will just say it since you are taking your time and you don't have a lot of that.

You went on the adventure to prove that you had something for a god. That every god that missed its chance to get you failed.

But no god ever answered your cry's.

Galiminus :........

Begalaz : and after That you made your way here to solve why.

And now I give it to you ,the reason that no god wants to work with you.

Me

Galiminus :y-you M-mon(ster)

Begalaz : now that I gave you that I want something in return 

Galiminus : w-what can y-you want from me

Begalaz :your service

Galiminus : (confused)

Begalaz : well you see you are one of the few things that I cannot balance and that is something the other gods don't need to know.

You Humans may be Petty but us gods are worse.

Galiminus : why now

Begalaz : well you See I tried many times but your fat skull never accepted my messages.

And I have enough to do so I didn't have time to go to you. And well you just came to me So that sparse Me a trip.

So do you accept to be my servant**
