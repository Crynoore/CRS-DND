*when chanting the runic Embedded thats on the sword it will light in silver with flames*

when hitting an enemy deals extra dmg  
- deal 2d4 fire dmg or 1d6 +1 radiant dmg (prototype makes is so on uneven dice roll this ability does not work )

- get a +2 to undead and when the undead is slain the body will be consume in with flames
