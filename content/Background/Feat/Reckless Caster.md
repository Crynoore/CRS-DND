Reckless Caster When granted this boon, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce power. When you make a spell attack which requires a save, you can decide to cast the spell recklessly. Doing so allows you to deal double damage when the target rolls a 1 on the save. However whenever you roll a 1 on a spell save you take double the damage.
